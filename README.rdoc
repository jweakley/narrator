Narrator is an activity library for Ruby on Rails that allow you to track what is happening on models and later use to build an activity or news stream. Tracking is done at the controller level with a simple narrate_resource command (which was inspired by the simplicity of Ryan Bates' CanCan gem).

== Installation

In <b> Rails 3 </b> add this line to your application's Gemfile and run the +bundle+ command.

    gem "narrator"

Once you have the Narrator gem installed you will need to run the generator:

    rails generate narrator:migration

This generator will add the migrations needed for the activity tracking. Currently this only works for ActiveRecord

== Getting Started

Narrator expects a +current_user+ method to exist in the controller. First, set up some authentication (such as Authlogic[https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic] or Devise[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise]).

=== 1. Mark a Model as Narratable

Any model that we would like to have tracked by narrator needs to have <tt>narratable_model</tt> added to it.

  class Article
    narratable_model
    ...
  end

See {Narrated Model}[https://github.com/jweakley/narrator/wiki/Narrated-Model] for more details and features.

=== 2. Narrate the Model's activities from the controller

The <tt>narrate</tt> method in the controller will narrate something important.

  def create
    ...
    @article = Article.new(params[:article])
    ...
    narrate @article if @article.save
    ....
  end

In this example, if the article is successfully saved, an activity gets logged for the article.

See {Tracked Activities}[https://github.com/jweakley/narrator/wiki/Tracked-Activities] for more details and features with tracked activities.

== Future Features

Automagical Narration

  class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
    narrate_resource

    def create
      ...
      respond_with @article
      # @article is automaticly tracked if it is valid
    end
  end
